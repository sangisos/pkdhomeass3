\section{preprocess}
Our preprocess is in itself constant as it only calls our auxillary function preprocess'.
\subsection{preprocess'}
Let n be the length of the list cl. The worst case is if every caracter in cl is a alpha character, and the length of cl modulus 5 is 1, as we then have to add 4 X:s.

This function spends most of it's time in the fifth case, where it removes the first character c of the char list cl, checks if it is a alpha character (constant time), if it's not, recurse with the char removed from cl, else make it uppercase (constant time), add it to chunk (constant time) and removes 1 from chunkSize (constant time), then recurses on the new data.

For every fifth (actually every chunkSize:th) character that is added to chunk, we enter the forth case in preprocess', where we reset the chunkSize, send a empty list as new chunk, revers the old chunk (linear to chunkSize, in this case five), and adds the reversed chunkSize to the list full (constant time).

When we reach the end of cl, we add X:s, but as it is such a small part of the total it is negligible.

At last the total list of chunks is reversed, liniar to the length of cl divided by chunkSize, in this case 5.

All in all, this gives us:

$$C(n) = C(n-1) + f(n)$$
$$f(n) = \Theta(1)$$
$$C(n) = \Theta(n)$$ for case five,


$$C(n) = C(n - chunkSize) + f(n)$$
$$f(n) = \Theta(chunkSize)$$
$$C(n) = \Theta(n)$$ for case four, and

$$C(n) = f(n)$$
$$f(n) = \Theta(n/5)$$
$$C(n) = \Theta(n/5) = \Theta(n)$$ for either of the first two cases.

And thus we get the whole function:
$$C(n) = 3 * \Theta(n) = \Theta(n)$$
